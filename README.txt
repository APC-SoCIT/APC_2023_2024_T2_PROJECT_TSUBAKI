Project Overview

Welcome to the ACMR Services CRM System repository! This project is initiated by 4YAKA,
a team of four dedicated computer science students, driven by a shared interest in tackling real-world problems and enhancing their skills.
The primary goal of this project is to address the challenges faced by ACMR Services, a business assistance service, in managing their workflow efficiently.

Vision

The vision of 4YAKA is to seek, provide, and grow. We aim to explore new paths and perspectives,
forging our own way and growing with each decision and project completion. Currently,
we are focused on expanding our skill set and applying these skills through projects that allow us to practice and sharpen our abilities.

Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that enables ACMR Services to manage and document work files and activities. Specific objectives include:

1. Centralized File Management:

Allow files to be stored centrally for quick access, retrieval, and version control.

2. Transparency and Communication:

Enforce transparency through open communication, reducing miscommunication errors.

3.Collaborative Environment:

Foster collaboration through the CRM system, enabling frequent communication and updates between clients and employees.

4. Analytics and Reporting:

Provide employees with the ability to view and interpret relevant metrics, predictive statistics, and transactional reports for informed decision-making.
